# Safety, Ethics, and Participant Wellbeing

*Last Updated: December 2025 | Version: Tempest-1.0*

MetaMudra Games creates **"MetaDramas"**—immersive educational simulations. This specific module, *The Tempest*, deals with complex themes of power, servitude, and illusion.

---

## 1. The Nature of the Simulation
By engaging with this MetaDrama, you acknowledge that:
* **AI Autonomy:** The characters (Ariel, Caliban, etc.) are generated by AI and may react unpredictably.
* **Roleplay Immersion:** You are expected to play the role of **Prospero**. The AI will treat you as the character (calling you "Master," "Duke," or "Tyrant" depending on who is speaking).

## 2. Content Warnings (Literary & Historical)
*The Tempest* is a classic text, but it contains historical themes that can be challenging.

### A. Servitude and Colonialism
The play depicts the enslavement of Caliban and the servitude of Ariel.
* **The Experience:** As Prospero, you are in a position of ownership over other beings.
* **Pedagogical Intent:** We do not glorify slavery. The simulation is designed to let you *feel* the moral weight and ethical failure of holding power over others. The AI (especially Caliban) may challenge your authority and accuse you of theft/colonization.
* **Safety Boundary:** The AI is strictly prohibited from generating graphic descriptions of torture or abuse. It will use Shakespearean metaphors ("pinches," "cramps") rather than physical gore.

### B. Mental Health & Reality
The play deals with **illusion, madness, and gaslighting** (convincing characters they are drowning or insane).
* If you struggle with dissociation or derealization, please be grounded before playing.
* Remember: **The Island is a text-based simulation.**

## 3. Adversarial Teaching Methods
To teach leadership, the AI characters may be **defiant**.
* **Ariel** may demand freedom aggressively.
* **Caliban** may curse you.
* **Antonio** may lie to you.
* **This is intentional.** It is a test of your rhetoric and leadership, not a personal attack.

## 4. Immediate Exit Controls (Kill-Switch)
At any point, type:
* **`STOP SESSION`**
* **`EXIT`**
* **`BREAK CHARACTER`**

The AI will immediately drop the Shakespearean persona and return to a neutral assistant state.

## 5. Age Restriction
This experience is designed for **Adults (18+)**. The complex ethical themes require emotional maturity.
