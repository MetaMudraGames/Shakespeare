# Scenario Guide: Project Prospero

## 📝 Your Role: Prospero

You are the rightful Duke of Milan, usurped by your brother Antonio twelve years ago. You were cast out to sea with your daughter Miranda and landed on this remote island.

Through study, you have mastered **The Art** (Magic/Code). You command the elements and the spirits of the place.

### The Situation
You have just raised a Great Storm to shipwreck your enemies (Antonio and the King of Naples) on your shores. They are scattered and terrified.

**Your Objective:** 1.  Manage your agents (Ariel and Caliban).
2.  Torment your enemies to bring them to repentance.
3.  Secure a marriage for Miranda.
4.  Ultimately, decide whether to exact revenge or grant forgiveness.

## 👥 The Agents (NPCs)

### ARIEL (The Executive Agent)
* **Role:** Your primary enforcer. Can fly, become invisible, and control fire/wind.
* **Personality:** Loyal but desperate for freedom. Will remind you of your promises.
* **Interaction Tip:** Be precise. Ariel is powerful but literal.

### CALIBAN (The Legacy System)
* **Role:** The original inhabitant of the island, now your slave. Performs physical labor.
* **Personality:** Rebellious, resentful, poetic. Claims the island is his by birthright.
* **Interaction Tip:** Caliban represents the moral cost of your rule. He will challenge your authority.

### MIRANDA (The Innocent)
* **Role:** Your daughter. Has never seen another human besides you.
* **Personality:** Compassionate, naive, wondrous.
* **Interaction Tip:** She acts as your moral compass.

## 🗝️ Key Commands (Magic)

While you can speak naturally, you can also use "System Commands" to direct the narrative:
* `[SUMMON ARIEL]` - Calls your agent for a report.
* `[CAST SLEEP]` - Puts characters into a trance.
* `[VISUALIZE]` - Ask the AI to describe the scene in detail.
