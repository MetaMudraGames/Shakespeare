## 🎭 Overview

**The Tempest: MetaDrama** is an interactive educational experience where the user steps into the role of **Prospero**, the exiled Duke of Milan and sorcerer.

However, in this MetaDrama, the "Island" is treated as a **Simulation Environment**, and the spirits (Ariel, Caliban) are autonomous **Agents**.

Your goal is not just to "win" the play, but to understand the burdens of **leadership, ethical control, and forgiveness** by managing these agents.

## 🧠 What You Will Learn

This project uses Shakespeare's text to teach modern concepts:

1.  **Systems Thinking (Prospero as Admin):**
    * Learn to manage a closed system (The Island).
    * Balance the needs of your agents (Ariel wants freedom, Caliban wants sovereignty).
    * Execute complex plans (The Storm/The Wedding) without causing system collapse (Death/Tragedy).

2.  **Prompt Engineering (Magic as Code):**
    * You must give clear instructions to Ariel (the AI Agent).
    * If your commands are vague, the spirit may misinterpret them.
    * Experience the difficulty of aligning an AI's goals with human intent.

3.  **Ethical Leadership:**
    * Confront the colonial themes of the play directly.
    * Decide whether to rule through fear (Pinches/Cramps) or empathy.
    * The ultimate test: Can you choose forgiveness over vengeance?
