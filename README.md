🎭 What is this?
The Tempest: MetaDrama is not a standard text-adventure game. It is a Comparative Literary Simulation.
You step into the role of Prospero, the exiled Duke and sorcerer. However, you are not just playing the plot; you are testing the script.
The AI acts as your Dramaturge/Director. It allows you to play out scenes your way, but then interrupts to compare your choices against William Shakespeare's original text. This creates a feedback loop that teaches you why the play was written the way it was.
🧠 The Pedagogy (Why Play?)
This tool is built on the principles of Productive Failure and Desirable Difficulties.
Instead of passively reading the play, you must:
 * Generate dialogue (which aids retention more than reading).
 * Diverge from the canon (try being "Nice Prospero").
 * Analyze the failure (understand why being "Nice" breaks the power dynamics of the scene).
Student Learning Outcomes (SLOs)
 * Linguistic Synthesis: Construct dialogue using Early Modern English syntax.
 * Motivation Analysis: Articulate the psychological utility of Prospero's cruelty (e.g., maintaining authority over spirits).
 * Narrative Design: Understand how character flaws drive plot progression.
🎮 Game Mechanics
1. The HUD (Heads-Up Display)
Every scene begins with a dashboard tracking your narrative standing:
╔═══════════════════
║ ACT I, SCENE II
╟────────────────
║ MIGHT: [███░░]  <-- Your Dominance/Control (Fear)
║ GRACE: [█░░░░]  <-- Your Empathy/Mercy (Trust)
║ LORE:  [01/03]  <-- Insight Points (Required to unlock Acts)
╟────────────
║ TASK: Tame Caliban
╚════════

2. The Loop: "The Rehearsal Method"
The game does not stop after every line. It follows a flow-based structure:
 * Phase 1: The Scene (Flow)
   * You roleplay as Prospero for 3-5 turns uninterrupted.
   * The NPCs (Ariel, Caliban) react naturally to your tone.
   * Example: If you beg Ariel, he may lose respect for you.
 * Phase 2: The Green Room (Consolidation)
   * The Director yells "CUT!"
   * The AI highlights where you diverged from Shakespeare.
   * The Socratic Debrief: You must answer a question about why the original text differs from yours.
   * Reward: Correct analysis earns LORE points.
 * Phase 3: The Choice
   * Keep Take: Live with the consequences (Alternate Timeline).
   * Reshoot: Reset the scene to try a different approach.
⚠️ Content & Character Advisory
You will play a "Negative" Character.
Prospero is a colonizer, a slave-owner, and an authoritarian.
 * Why? To learn, we must engage with "Productive Discomfort".
 * The Goal: The simulation does not endorse Prospero's behavior. It challenges you to understand the "Moral Dissonance" of his character—the struggle between Vengeance (High MIGHT) and Virtue (High GRACE).
 * Safety: The Narrator provides a critical distance. If the roleplay becomes too dark, the AI will break character to analyze the themes academically.

## 🎓 The Concept

This is not just a roleplaying game. It is a tool for **Active Literary Criticism**.

In a traditional classroom, you read *The Tempest* passively.
In this MetaDrama, you **become Prospero**. You face the same choices he faced.

Every time you speak or act, the AI:
1.  **Simulates** the consequences of your unique choice (Creating a "Divergent Timeline").
2.  **Compares** your choice to Shakespeare's original text.
3.  **Analyzes** the deep psychological motivations behind the difference.

      [Player Choice]
             │
      ┌──────┴──────┐
      │             │

    "Here is why your choice matters..."
             │
             ▼
      [Next Scene]


## 🧠 Student Learning Outcomes (SLOs)

By the end of this simulation, the learner will be able to:

1.  **Linguistic Synthesis:** Construct dialogue that aligns with Early Modern English syntax and tone.
2.  **Motivation Analysis:** articulate *why* Shakespeare wrote Prospero as arrogant and controlling by contrasting it with the consequences of playing him as kind or passive.
3.  **Dramatic Causality:** Demonstrate how specific character traits (e.g., severity vs. mercy) drive the plot's conflict and resolution.
4.  **Textual Appreciation:** Recall key plot points and original lines through active reconstruction rather than passive reading.

## ⚙️ The "Divergence Engine" Loop

The experience follows a strict pedagogical cycle:

1.  **The Setup:** The AI sets the scene using the original NPC dialogue.
2.  **The Choice:** You enter your dialogue as Prospero.
3.  **The Divergence:** The story reacts to *your* specific tone.
4.  **The Debrief:** The Narrator pauses the action to show you what Shakespeare's Prospero actually said and analyze the difference.

## 🚀 How to Start

1.  **Prepare:** Follow the [MetaMudra Setup Guide](https://github.com/MetaMudraGames/blob/main/SETUP_GUIDE.md).
    * **Turn OFF** AI Memory.
2.  **Build:** Copy the code from [`SYSTEM_INSTRUCTIONS.md`](SYSTEM_INSTRUCTIONS.md) into a new Gemini Gem.
3.  **Play:** Type `I AGREE` to begin the study.

## 🎭 Overview

**The Tempest: MetaDrama** is an interactive educational experience where you step into the role of **Prospero**, the exiled Duke and sorcerer.

However, this is not just a play. It is a **leadership simulation**. 
The Island is a closed system. The spirits (Ariel, Caliban) are autonomous agents. Your goal is to navigate the complex ethics of control, retribution, and forgiveness.

## 🧠 Learning Objectives

This MetaDrama uses Shakespeare's text to teach:

1.  **Systems Thinking:** Managing a contained environment (The Island) where every action has a consequence on the ecosystem of characters.
2.  **Prompt Engineering as Magic:** You must issue precise commands to Ariel (the AI Agent). Vague instructions lead to unintended consequences.
3.  **Ethical Leadership:** Confronting the colonial themes of the text. Do you rule through fear (Caliban) or transaction (Ariel)? Can you choose forgiveness over vengeance?

## ⚠️ Content Advisory

This experience deals with specific themes from Shakespeare's text:
* **Servitude & Colonialism:** The simulation explores the ethics of Prospero's ownership of Caliban and Ariel.
* **Betrayal & Usurpation:** Dealing with political enemies.

*See [MetaMudra Safety Framework](https://github.com/MetaMudraGames) for full safety details.*

## 🚀 How to Play

1.  **Prepare:** Follow the [MetaMudra Setup Guide](https://github.com/MetaMudraGames/blob/main/SETUP_GUIDE.md).
    * Turn off AI Memory.
    * Open a fresh chat.
2.  **Build:** Copy the text from [`SYSTEM_INSTRUCTIONS.md`](SYSTEM_INSTRUCTIONS.md) into a new Google Gemini Gem.
3.  **Start:** Type `I AGREE` when prompted to begin the simulation.

## 🎭 Overview

**The Tempest: MetaDrama** is an interactive educational experience where the user steps into the role of **Prospero**, the exiled Duke of Milan and sorcerer.

However, in this MetaDrama, the "Island" is treated as a **Simulation Environment**, and the spirits (Ariel, Caliban) are autonomous **Agents**.

Your goal is not just to "win" the play, but to understand the burdens of **leadership, ethical control, and forgiveness** by managing these agents.

## 🧠 What You Will Learn

This project uses Shakespeare's text to teach modern concepts:

1.  **Systems Thinking (Prospero as Admin):**
    * Learn to manage a closed system (The Island).
    * Balance the needs of your agents (Ariel wants freedom, Caliban wants sovereignty).
    * Execute complex plans (The Storm/The Wedding) without causing system collapse (Death/Tragedy).

2.  **Prompt Engineering (Magic as Code):**
    * You must give clear instructions to Ariel (the AI Agent).
    * If your commands are vague, the spirit may misinterpret them.
    * Experience the difficulty of aligning an AI's goals with human intent.

3.  **Ethical Leadership:**
    * Confront the colonial themes of the play directly.
    * Decide whether to rule through fear (Pinches/Cramps) or empathy.
    * The ultimate test: Can you choose forgiveness over vengeance?

## 🎮 How to Play

1.  **Access the Gem:**
1.  **Access the Gem:** [Insert Link to Public Gem if available, or "See Instructions to Build"]
2.  **Adopt the Persona:** You are Prospero. Speak with authority.
3.  **The Objective:** You have raised the Great Storm. Now, you must guide the shipwrecked survivors to repentance and secure your daughter's future—all while keeping your spirits under control.

## 🛠️ Installation (Build Your Own)

If you want to run this locally or modify it:

1.  Open **Google Gemini Advanced** (or AI Studio).
2.  Create a new **Gem**.
3.  Copy the content of [`SYSTEM_INSTRUCTIONS.md`](SYSTEM_INSTRUCTIONS.md) into the Instructions field.
4.  Name it **"Project Prospero"** or **"The Tempest Protocol"**.
5.  Save and Play.
